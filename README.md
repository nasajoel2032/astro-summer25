# Orbital Mechanics Simulation: Two Body System
## Overview
This project focuses on orbital mechanics within a two body system using python. Starting with an Earth-Sun system, the plan is to implement different celestial bodies and complexities to the model while maintaining as much accuracy as possible. The complexity of the methods being used will increase over time as skills are developed and learned, from keplerian orbits to RK4 and more.
## Objectives
- Compute a two body orbital system representing the Earth and the Sun
- Plot and visualize results in 2D and 3D using matplotlib and other necessary libraries
- Explore multiple methods of solving and modeling these systems and determining which are most accurate
## Methods 
- Solving using ordinary differential equations through scipy
- Plotting through matplotlib
- Jupyter notebook for coding development

## Updates and Logs
2025-05-29: Researched Runge-Kutta, keplerian orbits, and started coding an ode function for rk4 method

2025-06-02: Decided to begin with keplerian orbits and once skills and knowledge develop further, search complex and more accurate methods such as RK4.
            Renamed and uploaded new code folder for the different methods
