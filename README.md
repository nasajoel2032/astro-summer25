# Orbital Mechanics Simulation: Two Body System
## Overview
This project focuses on orbital mechanics within a two body system using python. Starting with an Earth-Sun system, the plan is to implement different celestial bodies and complexities to the model while maintaining as much accuracy as possible. 
## Objectives
- Compute a two body orbital system representing the Earth and the Sun
- Plot and visualize results in 2D and 3D using matplotlib and other necessary libraries
- Explore multiple methods of solving and modeling these systems and determining which are most accurate
## Methods 
- Solving using ordinary differential equations through scipy
- Plotting through matplotlib
- Jupyter notebook for coding development
